一. 开头直接给出题干，后面的描述围绕前面的题干展开。
通常这种，考题一般是考文章段落的主题思想，所以第一句很重要。
例1:
A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.
思考题：
55. In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, ________.
　　[A] rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US
　　[B] small-minded officials deserve a serious comment
　　[C] Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors  
    [D] most Americans are ready to offer help
例2:
In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. "Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people.
思考题：

二. 查找生词的含义。
例1:
During the first year of his administration, President Trump signed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code. While Republicans cast it as a boon to the middle class, lower- and middle-income taxpayers saw only moderate tax relief while the highest earners received a substantial windfall. 
What does “windfall” probably mean？
(A) the great blow 
(B) the big splash 
(C) the unexpected return
(D) the inflating balloon 
注意里面的while转折点，找和前面描述相反的含义。
